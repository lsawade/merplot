merplot documentation!
===================================

.. image:: _static/figures/static_mermaid.jpg

Hi! This is the landing page for the merplot documentation. To find out about
what a Mermaid is, checkout out `earthscopeoceans.org <http://earthscopeoceans
.org>`_. `merplot` is a simple tool that plots maps (as seen above) or
animations of the Mermaid locations and trajectories using their so called
`.vit` vital files.
The Github repository for the mapping code is located `here <https://github
.com/lsawade/merplot>`_. The main dependencies as of now are matplotlib,
numpy, cartopy (for the maps), and ObsPy.
