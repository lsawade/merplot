# This is a filter info yaml file for all current mermaids. As of now, this
# file only contains the time filter list. See Mermaid 23 for multiple filter
# windows. The filter list is loaded using the yaml module into a dictionary
# of lists. This makes the filter file human readable and modifiable in the
# future. Making the time_filter a list enables us to very simply choose
# multiple windows that can be excluded.
